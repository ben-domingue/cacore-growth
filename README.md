# Growth estimates for the CA CORE districts

## Code index
- 00_data.R preparing the data for analysis
- 01_descriptives.R descriptive statistics
- 02_model.R running basic growth model
- 03_analysis.R analysis of the growth estimates

## issues
- compute 2024 results [problems with code at present]

- the m2 coefficients (specially the lagged mean) are pretty small. is something off? 
- why are growth estimates so correlated with delta for just ela?
- stability/precision/oos: bootstrap analyses?
