## Code index

- 03_analysis.R analysis of the growth estimates

## issues

- the m2 coefficients (specially the lagged mean) are pretty small. is something off? 
- why are growth estimates so correlated with delta for just ela?
- stability/precision/oos: look at correlations between 2025 and 2024 results
